# Contributing to Python Media Toolkit

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This is an educational project, and contributions are welcome.

## How to Contribute

### Adding New Features

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch
2. **Make your changes** - Keep code clean and well-commented
3. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure everything works
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Adding New Platform Support

The Media Downloader can be extended to support more platforms. Here's how:

1. **Update platform detection** in `toolkit.py` around line 643:
```python
def detect_platform(url):
    """Detect the platform from a given URL"""
    if "newplatform.com" in url:
        return "ðŸ†• New Platform"
    # ... existing platforms
```

2. **Test with yt-dlp** - Make sure yt-dlp supports the platform:
```bash
yt-dlp --list-formats <url>
```

3. **Add platform-specific options** if needed (around line 1481)

### Code Style

- Use clear variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing code patterns
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] UI updates correctly
- [ ] Progress tracking works
